# Data Sonification: Approaches, applications, and limitations (with implementation in Python)

This work focused on exploring possible applications of data sonification. To do this task, I will not only check existing works and solutions. Also, create a small Python library to be able to check my hypothesizes. This repo purpose is to store the sonification library, collect materials for my research, and make some notes of the working process.
