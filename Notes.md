***08.03*** I have tried VCV Rack, but probably writing a sound synthesizer is overkill.
      Suggestion: Finds libraries that utilize samples/loops. Read the handbook.
                  Write about the visualization equivalent of sonification.

***09.03*** It would be interesting to use samples instead of notes and use some effects/distortions on them as loud numbers do. 

***15.03*** I will be using pyAudio to play sound, wave to read it, and numpy to apply different effects. Find a book on digital sound processing.

***16.03*** Just use js lol https://tonejs.github.io/docs/r13/Buffer
