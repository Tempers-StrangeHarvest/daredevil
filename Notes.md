***08.03*** I have tried VCV Rack, but probably writing a sound synthesizer is overkill.
      Suggestion: Finds libraries that utilize samples/loops. Read the handbook.
                  Write about the visualization equivalent of sonification.

***09.03*** It would be interesting to use samples instead of notes and use some affects/distortions on them like loud numbers do.
